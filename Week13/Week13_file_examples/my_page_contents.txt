Hi, I am Cihan. We are coding in Python. It is very exciting and I enjoy to play with it. I am physicist. I love Pyhsics and Mathematics like as programming. Python programming language is more suitable and integrable with these areas. We can many implementations and applications with using Python programming language. Python help us to make many comprehensive and applicable simulations to observe and adjust many phenomenological states and problems inside Pyhsics and Mathematics. Python is a collaborative tool to make this issues more easily. We can also use Python programming environments to evaluate machine learning, deep learning, image processing, AI studies etc. with using the tools which have generated for these areas.
